| --------- | ----------- |
| square.py | Correction: Line 14, change the second `self.width` to be `self.height` instead. This accounts for a user inputting a height that's a different value than the width. Change class name to start with a capital, remove capitals from method names, and added comments where needed. Of course, check pep8 compliancy. |
| user.py | Correction:  |
| status_server | Correction: File `api/v1/views/index.py` on line 9, remove the leading url_prefix: `/api/v1` as already defined to include it in the Blueprint. |
| blog | Correction:  |
| react-blog | Correction:  |
